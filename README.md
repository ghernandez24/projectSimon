### Hurdles
This was not a simple task as this was my first game ever built thorugh javascript. There was a bit of DOM manipulation. The hardest part for me was applying the flash function to work with the corresding array value and setting an pause. Although this was a challenge, I look forward to continue to grow and accelerate my journey as a software developer.
